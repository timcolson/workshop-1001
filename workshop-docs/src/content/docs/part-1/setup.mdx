import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Before you can add upgrades, you need a working example webapp! The workshop provides code for a crude recipe webapp.

## App Features

The baseline app consists of:

- Flask webapp to browse, view, and search recipes
- Static data in files (JSON) for simplicity
- Template files to separate HTML views from code

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (tested with 3.14)
- Git

## Setup Steps

<Steps>

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/timcolson/workshop-1001
   cd workshop-1001
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="macOS/Linux">
       ```bash
       python -m venv venv
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Windows">
       ```bash
       python -m venv venv
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

4. **Run the webapp**
   ```bash
   flask run --app app.py
   ```

5. **Open in browser**

   Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

</Steps>

:::tip[Success!]
You should have a working recipe webapp. Browse the list of recipes, view some recipe details, navigate back to the list, go to the next page, and run a search.

## Try It Out

The app works, but the user experience (UX) isn't great, is it? Why not?

- Separate page loads for every action
- Manual paging through results
- Search requires form submission

Next, let's discuss [why we should upgrade](/part-1/why-upgrade) to a dynamic app.
