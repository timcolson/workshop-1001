## Consider upgrading to a dynamic app

What are some ways you might upgrade the app to be more fluid?

- **Better UX** — show the recipe details inline, without a separate page load
- **Infinite scroll** — without "pages"
- **Dynamic Search** — server-side index with results as you type

## A Brief History of Web Architecture

### Web 1.0 (circa 1990)

The original World Wide Web model:

```
User → Request (HTTP) → Server → Response (HTML)
```

### Single Page Applications (2005+)

AJAX ushered in asynchronous dynamic websites. Google Mail was one of the first examples:

```
User → Request → Server → SPA (HTML + JS) → Request from App → Response (JSON) → repeat
```

### Hypermedia Frameworks (2020+)

JavaScript is ubiquitous. Web front ends are amazing but also complex. Users want dynamic webapps. Developers struggle with the complexity. Sometimes, you just need dynamic HTML.

**HTMX approach:**
```
User → Request → Server → (HTML + HTMX) → Request from App → Partial Response (HTML) → repeat
```

**Datastar approach:**
```
User → Request → Server → (HTML + Datastar) → Server Sent Event (SSE) → Signal to patch DOM → repeat
```

## Hypermedia First

Both HTMX and Datastar feature a *hypermedia first* approach:

- **HTMX**: Use additional HTML attributes to create requests from your app to the server
- **Datastar**: Modify your app state with events sent from the server

### HTMX Example

Click invokes a GET action, server sends back HTML:

```html title="recipe link with HTMX"
<a href="#"
    hx-get="{{ url_for('endpoint', recipe_id=recipe.index) }}"
    hx-target="#recipe-details">Recipe 1</a>
```

### Datastar Example

Click invokes a GET action, server sends an event back with data:

```html title="button with Datastar"
<button data-on:click="@get('/endpoint')">
    Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
</button>
<div id="hal"></div>
```

## Key Differences

HTMX adds new `hx-` prefixed attributes to existing HTML tags. Datastar extends HTML through `data-` prefixed attributes using the HTML `data-*` standard (hence the name "data star").

Both rely on JavaScript to do their thing, but JavaScript is somewhat hidden from you, the developer.

We'll explore the similarities and differences later, but let's dive into some upgrades with HTMX!
