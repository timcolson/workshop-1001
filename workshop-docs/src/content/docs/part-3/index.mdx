2026-01-22 8:31:42AM MST - Datastar additions were made by Claude.ai and have **NOT** been tested! 
:::


Datastar is another hypermedia framework which combines concepts from HTMX and Alpine.js. Datastar uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates and provides built-in reactive signals for client-side state management.



## Feature Comparison

| Feature | HTMX | Datastar |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Philosophy** | Adds to existing HTML specification; minimal and unopinionated | Combines features of HTMX and Alpine.js, aiming for high-performance live updates; minimal and more opinionated |
| **Response Type** | Primarily expects HTML fragments in response | Can send HTML fragments, JSON, or JavaScript |
| **Update Logic** | Client-driven: logic scattered across HTML attributes that trigger requests | Server-driven: server decides what should change, keeping logic in one place |
| **Primary Protocol** | AJAX (HTTP requests) | Server-Sent Events (SSE) (server "pushes" updates) |
| **Real-time Updates** | Requires polling or writing custom WebSocket code | Built-in real-time updates via SSE |
| **Client-side Reactivity** | No built-in state management; often paired with Alpine.js for reactivity | Built-in reactive signals (similar to Alpine.js) |

## Key Differences

### HTMX Approach
- Uses `hx-*` attributes on HTML elements
- Client initiates all requests
- Server responds with HTML fragments
- Simple mental model: "click triggers request, response replaces element"

### Datastar Approach
- Uses `data-*` attributes (standard HTML data attributes)
- Server can push updates to client via SSE
- Reactive signals for client-side state
- More features built-in, but more to learn

## Code Comparison

### HTMX Example

```html title="HTMX button"
<button hx-get="/api/data"
        hx-target="#result"
        hx-trigger="click">
    Load Data
</button>
<div id="result"></div>
```

### Datastar Example

```html title="Datastar button"
<button data-on:click="@get('/api/data')">
    Load Data
</button>
<div id="result"></div>
```

## When to choose?

**Choose HTMX when:**
- You want minimal learning curve
- Your use case is mostly click-to-load interactions
- You prefer explicit, attribute-based behavior
- [HTMX Documentation](https://htmx.org/)

**Choose Datastar when:**
- You need real-time server-pushed updates
- You want built-in reactive state management
- You're building highly interactive applications
- [Datastar Documentation](https://data-star.dev/)

</CardGrid>

## Getting Started

Before implementing the features, you'll need to:

1. Add the Datastar library to your templates
2. Set up Server-Sent Events endpoints in your Flask app
3. Use Datastar's reactive signals for state management

:::note[Base App]
Make sure you're starting from the base `app.py` (not `app-htmx.py`) for these Datastar implementations.
