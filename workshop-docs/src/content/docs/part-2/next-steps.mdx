## What You Learned

You've successfully upgraded the Recipe Browser with HTMX! Here's the pattern you followed for each feature:

### The HTMX Upgrade Pattern

1. **Add HTMX attributes to trigger elements**
   - `hx-get` - URL to fetch content
   - `hx-target` - Element to update with response
   - `hx-trigger` - Event that triggers the request
   - `hx-swap` - How to insert the new content

2. **Modify server routes to return HTML fragments**
   - Check for fragment requests (or always return fragments for partial endpoints)
   - Render just the needed HTML, not full pages

3. **Create fragment templates**
   - Small, focused templates for partial updates
   - Reusable across different features

### Features Implemented

| Feature | Trigger | Target |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Inline Details | Click recipe link | `#recipe-details` panel |
| Live Search | Input with debounce | `#recipe-list` |
| Infinite Scroll | Scroll intersection | Replace trigger `<li>` |

## Reset for Part 3

Want to try the Datastar approach? Reset your code to the baseline state first:

```bash
git checkout -- templates/ app.py
```

This reverts:
- Template changes (HTMX attributes, fragments)
- Server route modifications

:::tip[Ready for Datastar?]
After resetting, head to [Part III: Datastar](/workshop-1001/part-3/) to implement the same features using Server-Sent Events.
