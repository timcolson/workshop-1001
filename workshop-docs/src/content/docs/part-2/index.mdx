With [HTMX](https://htmx.org/), you can add dynamic behavior to your web app using HTML attributes — no JavaScript required. HTMX extends HTML with attributes such as `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-trigger` that tell the browser to make requests and swap content directly in the page.

## How HTMX Works

1. **Add attributes** to HTML elements to define what triggers a request and where the response goes
2. **Server returns HTML fragments** — not JSON, not a full page, just the piece that changed
3. **HTMX swaps the fragment** into the DOM, replacing or appending content as specified

```html title="HTMX example"
<button hx-get="/api/data"
        hx-target="#result"
        hx-trigger="click">
    Load Data
</button>
<div id="result"></div>
```

When clicked, HTMX sends a GET request to `/api/data` and replaces the contents of `#result` with the server's HTML response.

## Key Concepts

- **`hx-get` / `hx-post`** — HTTP method and URL to request
- **`hx-target`** — CSS selector for the element to update
- **`hx-trigger`** — Event that initiates the request (click, input, intersect, etc.)
- **`hx-swap`** — How to insert the response (innerHTML, outerHTML, beforeend, etc.)
- **`HX-Request` header** — Sent automatically by HTMX so the server can detect HTMX requests and return a fragment instead of a full page

## HTMX Upgrades

You'll implement three features using this pattern:

- [Inline Recipe Details](/workshop-1001/part-2/inline-details/) — Display details in a side panel without page reload
- [Live Search Results](/workshop-1001/part-2/live-search/) — Dynamic search with debouncing
- [Infinite Scroll](/workshop-1001/part-2/infinite-scroll/) — Load more recipes as user scrolls

:::note[Base App]
Make sure you're starting from the base `app.py` (not `app-datastar.py`) for these HTMX implementations.
