description: Upgrade to a dynamic app with HTMX
---

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You will upgrade the app to dynamically show recipe details, return live search results, and infinitely scroll the recipe list.

## Understanding the App Structure

Before you make changes, you need to see how the app is currently structured.

The recipe app is built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) which is a well-known web framework for Python:

- **`app.py`** — Main entry point with routes for home, recipe list, details, and search
- **`models.py`** — Provides a *Recipe* data model and repository for fetching recipes
- **`templates/`** — HTML templates that separate views from code

:::note[Log Filtering]
You might notice `Status304Filter` in `app.py` — it simplifies log output by not recording *not modified* entries for static assets like CSS.

## Routes and Templates

Each route retrieves data and renders a template:

- **Standalone page templates** (`home.html`, `recipe.html`, `search.html`) can include reusable *fragments*
- **Full pages** extend a common `layout.html` template which includes CSS and JavaScript
- **Depending on your needs**, a route can return a full HTML page or a smaller chunk of HTML

That flexibility will be important for making dynamic upgrades!
