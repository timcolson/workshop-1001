## Common Issues

### Access to 127.0.0.1 was denied

**Symptom**: Chrome refuses to connect to your Flask app

**Solution**: Flush Chrome's socket pools

1. Open Chrome and navigate to: `chrome://net-internals/#sockets`
2. Click "Flush socket pools"
3. Try accessing your app again

### Flask not finding templates

**Symptom**: `TemplateNotFound` error

**Solution**: Make sure you're running Flask from the project root directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/workshop-1001
flask run --app app.py
```

### HTMX requests not working

**Symptom**: Clicking links does nothing or full page loads

**Checklist**:

1. **Is HTMX loaded?** Check browser DevTools → Network tab for the HTMX script
2. **Check for JavaScript errors** in browser console
3. **Verify the `hx-*` attributes** are spelled correctly
4. **Check target element exists** — the `hx-target` selector must match an element ID

### HX-Request header not detected

**Symptom**: Server returns full page instead of fragment

**Debug**: Add logging to your route:

```python title="app.py"
@app.route('/recipe/<int:recipe_id>')
def recipe_detail(recipe_id):
    print(f"HX-Request: {request.headers.get('HX-Request')}")
    # ...
```

### CSS not applying to HTMX-loaded content

**Symptom**: Dynamically loaded content looks unstyled

**Causes**:
- CSS might be scoped to elements that don't exist in fragments
- Class names might be different in fragment vs. full page

**Solution**: Ensure fragments use the same CSS classes as the full page

### Changes not appearing after code edit

**Symptom**: You edited a file but nothing changed

**Solutions**:

1. **Restart Flask** — templates are often cached
   ```bash
   # Stop with Ctrl+C, then restart
   flask run --app app.py
   ```

2. **Hard refresh browser** — `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

3. **Check you edited the right file** — easy to edit the wrong template!

## Getting Help
