import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

These are optional challenges for those who want to explore further!

## Challenge Ideas

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Favorite Recipes" icon="star">
    Add a "star" to favorite a recipe and show favorites in a list.

    **Complexity**: Need to save user preferences (no DB currently)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time Updates" icon="rocket">
    Use SSE to push updates to the client

    **Ideas**:
    - Multiple users on the same server
    - When Alvin favorites a recipe, Becky sees it in real-time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Collaborative Editing" icon="pencil">
    Edit recipe categories collaboratively

    **Ideas**:
    - Flag recipe as "Being edited by NAME"
    - Upon save, move recipe to category (Main, Dessert, Beverage)
  </Card>
  <Card title="HTMX Pagination" icon="list-format">
    Convert Next/Previous buttons to HTMX

    **Goal**: Don't lose selected recipe when paging
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Favorite Recipes Deep Dive

### Requirements

1. Add a star icon next to each recipe
2. Clicking the star favorites/unfavorites the recipe
3. Show a favorites count or list somewhere

### Implementation Hints

```html title="Favorite button concept" ins={2-5}
<li>
    <button hx-post="{{ url_for('toggle_favorite', recipe_id=recipe.index) }}"
            hx-swap="outerHTML"
            class="favorite-btn {% if recipe.is_favorited %}active{% endif %}">
        ⭐
    </button>
    <a href="#" hx-get="...">{{ recipe.name }}</a>
</li>
```

### Challenges to Solve

- **Storage**: Where to store favorites? (Session, localStorage, database?)
- **State**: How to track which recipes are favorited?
- **UI**: How to display favorites list?

## Real-time with SSE

This is where Datastar really shines, but you can do it with HTMX too.

### HTMX SSE Extension

```html title="SSE with HTMX"
<div hx-ext="sse"
     sse-connect="/events"
     sse-swap="message">
    Waiting for updates...
</div>
```

### Server-side (Flask)

```python title="app.py - SSE endpoint"
from flask import Response
import time

@app.route('/events')
def events():
    def generate():
        while True:
            # Check for new data
            yield f"data: <div>Update at {time.time()}</div>\n\n"
            time.sleep(5)
    return Response(generate(), mimetype='text/event-stream')
```
