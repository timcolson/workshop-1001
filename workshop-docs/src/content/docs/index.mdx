title: Intro to HTMX & Datastar with Python
description: Build dynamic web apps without the JavaScript complexity
---

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Want to make a dynamic web app, without a bunch of JavaScript or React?

With [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) or [Datastar](https://data-star.dev/), your server-side Python can send HTML to dynamically update the view for your users. By the end of this hour-long workshop, you will understand the model for building reactive, dynamic websites using two popular hypermedia frameworks.
